# Instagram Box Bootstrap

A easy way to load and show your latest posts

## Instagram API

You don't need to use the Instagram API. We can get all datas about the posts here: `https://www.instagram.com/YOU_USER_NAME_ON_INSTAGRAM/?__a=1`

## Use

Clone the project and open `instagram.html` look for this line `let name = "YOUR_USER_NAME";` and change the user name. Save and your bootstrap section is done.
